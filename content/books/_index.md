I read things, including: textbooks, novels, comic books, etc.
Below is an incomplete list of things I have read, and things I am currently reading (*),
in reverse chronological order.

- (*) **Designing Data Intensive Applications --- Martin Kleppmann**<br>
- (*) **Project Hail Mary --- Andy Weir**<br>
- **The Man Who Solved the Market: How Jim Simons Launched the Quant Revolution --- Gregory Zuckerman**<br>
  Great, though a _tad_ too much politics in the latter half for my taste.
- **The Soul of a New Machine --- Tracy Kidder**<br>
  Quaint, but nonetheless excellent. A hidden gem of computing culture. High recommendation for a specific kind of reader; if you liked Masters of Doom, possibly you.
- **Batman: The Dark Knight Returns --- Miller, Janson, and Varley**<br>
  Aged impressively well.
- **Flash Boys --- Michael Lewis**<br>
  Great, if interested in the subject matter.
- **Stories of your Life --- Ted Chiang**<br>
  Good, and may be a great choice for a sci-fi novice, considering the bite-sized stories.
- **Masters of Doom --- David Kushner**<br>
  Absolutely brilliant. In my opinion, faultless. If I could only recommend a single book from this list, it'd be this one.
- **Watchmen --- Moore and Gibbons**<br>
  Unexpectedly excellent.
- **Cryptonomicon --- Neal Stephenson**<br>
  Great hacker fiction.
- **GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach --- Douglas Hofstadter**<br>
  Great accompaniment to a Computer Science education, dispells any confusion to what "Computer Science" is, as opposed to "Software Engineering".
