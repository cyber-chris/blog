I read things, including: textbooks, novels, comic books, etc.
Below is an incomplete list of things I have read, and things I am currently reading (*),
in reverse chronological order.

- (*) **Worm --- John C. McCrae**<br>
- **Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality --- Eliezer Yudkowsky**<br>
  Remarkably entertaining & inventive fiction. This easily takes the spot of my favourite piece of fiction I've read (so far). (Notably, I was surprised at how interesting and, even, informative it could be without a scientifically accurate universe: that "good decision-making" can exist regardless.)
- **Project Hail Mary --- Andy Weir**<br>
  Great ideas, and surprisingly readable. Definitely "science-fiction" but most concepts are logically justified/grounded.
- **"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!" --- Richard P. Feynman**<br>
  Quite entertaining, and a surprisingly easy read. Recommended to anyone. (Although, if you expected much actual physics, you would be disappointed.)
- **The Man Who Solved the Market: How Jim Simons Launched the Quant Revolution --- Gregory Zuckerman**<br>
  Great, though a _tad_ too much politics in the latter half for my taste.
- **The Soul of a New Machine --- Tracy Kidder**<br>
  Quaint, but nonetheless excellent. A hidden gem of computing culture. High recommendation for a specific kind of reader; if you liked Masters of Doom, possibly you.
- **Batman: The Dark Knight Returns --- Miller, Janson, and Varley**<br>
  Aged impressively well.
- **Flash Boys --- Michael Lewis**<br>
  Great, if interested in the subject of HFT.
- **Stories of your Life --- Ted Chiang**<br>
  Good, and may be a great choice for a sci-fi novice, considering the bite-sized stories.
- **Masters of Doom --- David Kushner**<br>
  Absolutely brilliant. In my opinion, faultless. If I could only recommend a single book from this list, it'd be this one.
- **Watchmen --- Moore and Gibbons**<br>
  Unexpectedly excellent.
- **Cryptonomicon --- Neal Stephenson**<br>
  Great hacker fiction.
- **GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach --- Douglas Hofstadter**<br>
  Great accompaniment to a Computer Science education, dispels any confusion to what "Computer Science" is, as opposed to "Software Engineering".
