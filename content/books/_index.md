I read things, including: textbooks, novels, comic books, etc.
Below is an incomplete list of things I have read, and things I am currently reading (*),
in reverse chronological order.

- (*) **How to Invent Everything --- Ryan North**<br>
  Good so far --- sufficient detail to get a strong mental model of things without being too dry.
  It does suffer a tad from "itemization", listing out important things without a particularly strong connective tissue.
- (DNF) **Worm --- John C. McCrae**<br>
  Excellent and enjoyable fiction; there are too few hours in the day.
- **2001: A Space Odyssey --- Arthur C. Clarke**<br>
  A good science-fiction novel. I highly recommend pairing with the actual movie, the combined experience is certainly greater than the parts. Arthur C. Clarke shines in poetic bits of writing, but admittedly the ideas aren't quite as engaging as modern sci-fi novels.
  Considering when it was written, however, excellent stuff.
- **Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality --- Eliezer Yudkowsky**<br>
  Remarkably entertaining & inventive fiction. This easily takes the spot of my favourite piece of fiction I've read (so far). (Notably, I was surprised at how interesting and, even, informative it could be without a scientifically accurate universe: that "good decision-making" can exist regardless.)
- **Project Hail Mary --- Andy Weir**<br>
  Great ideas, and surprisingly readable. Definitely "science-fiction" but most concepts are logically justified/grounded.
- **"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!" --- Richard P. Feynman**<br>
  Quite entertaining, and a surprisingly easy read. Recommended to anyone. (Although, if you expected much actual physics, you would be disappointed.)
- **The Man Who Solved the Market: How Jim Simons Launched the Quant Revolution --- Gregory Zuckerman**<br>
  Great, though a _tad_ too much politics in the latter half for my taste.
- **The Soul of a New Machine --- Tracy Kidder**<br>
  Quaint, but nonetheless excellent. A hidden gem of computing culture. High recommendation for a specific kind of reader; if you liked Masters of Doom, possibly you.
- **Batman: The Dark Knight Returns --- Miller, Janson, and Varley**<br>
  Aged impressively well.
- **Flash Boys --- Michael Lewis**<br>
  Great, if interested in the subject of HFT.
- **Stories of your Life --- Ted Chiang**<br>
  Good, and may be a great choice for a sci-fi novice, considering the bite-sized stories.
- **Masters of Doom --- David Kushner**<br>
  Absolutely brilliant. In my opinion, faultless. If I could only recommend a single book from this list, it'd be this one.
- **Watchmen --- Moore and Gibbons**<br>
  Unexpectedly excellent.
- **Cryptonomicon --- Neal Stephenson**<br>
  Great hacker fiction.
- **Gödel, Escher, Bach --- Douglas Hofstadter**<br>
  Great accompaniment to a Computer Science education, dispels any confusion to what "Computer Science" is, as opposed to "Software Engineering".
