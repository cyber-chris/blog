I'm currently working on a research project at Cambridge as part of my MPhil, applying deep learning to cancer diagnosis.
[Here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/145Vl49C0yxfur97bsYdOYu7JZ2yFaolpAr_8o3oTlyc/edit?usp=sharing) are some slides I presented at a college conference. I'll fill this page with more detail later in the year.
