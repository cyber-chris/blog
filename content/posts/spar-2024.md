I've completed a research project with a small group, facilitated by [SPAR](https://sparai.org/). Our primary goal was to investigate the relationship between the complexity of a backdoor and its persistence to safety training.
Notably, I designed and trained a family of arithmetic-based backdoors in llama3 (with QLoRA finetuning).

Our code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/starship006/better_sleeper_agents) and a writeup of our findings is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DQpcKlbmbVxu-A1oRkKWR6n1uV8zUV2CvKq-Fhl3cBE/edit?usp=sharing).

The shortened summary is that I didn't find evidence that persistence changes between simpler vs. more complex versions of my arithmetic backdoor.
