I built a boid simulation with Blazor that allows you to toggle the three
rules, as well some other options. Check it out [here](https://cyberchris.xyz/BlazorBoids/).

Notably, you can switch between rendering in JS, or through Blazor's API, with significant
performance effects. (Spoilers: JS is way faster.)
