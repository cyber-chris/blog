[case-converter](https://github.com/thevirtuoso1973/case-converter) is a
[free and open-source](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html) command-line
application to convert the case of matched sections of text into other cases.
It's a convenient alternative to using a sed script.

I coded it in a day mostly to learn how to properly write modern (at the time of writing)
Python applications, using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and pytest.
