I recently completed a 'virtual internship' lead by JP Morgan on InsideSherpa's
platform. Here's the [certificate of completion](/pdfs/CertificateOfCompletion.pdf). I
worked on some interesting tasks like:

1. Interfacing with a stock-price data feed.
2. Using JPMorgan Chase's frameworks and tools.
3. Displaying data visually for traders.
