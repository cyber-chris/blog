A 'breakout' clone for the microbit.
Probably the smallest (graphically speaking) version of the Breakout game, uses
25 pixels/leds (arranged as a 5x5 grid).

This is the [repo/python
code](https://github.com/thevirtuoso1973/Microbit-Breakout). Check the releases
for a hex file you can copy to your own micro:bit.
