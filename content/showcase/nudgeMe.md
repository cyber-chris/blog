_This was a fairly extensive project undertaken as part of one of my modules,
and although I don't usually mention university work in `Showcase`, this is
an exception since everything we did was self-learned._

I was team leader for a team of two (including me), and we built a full-stack
cross-platform mobile application designed to help the UK population track and share
their wellbeing & steps. The mobile client was built with `Flutter` and the
back-end in `Go`.

Our dedicated [project site](http://students.cs.ucl.ac.uk/2020/group26/index.html)
has the full details.
