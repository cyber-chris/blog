Check it out here.
Notably, you can switch between rendering in JS, or through Blazor&amp;rsquo;s API, with significant performance effects. (Spoilers: JS is way faster.)</description></item><item><title>NudgeMe: Cross-Platform Mobile Wellbeing Tracker</title><link>https://cyberchris.xyz/showcase/nudgeme/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cyberchris.xyz/showcase/nudgeme/</guid><description>This was a fairly extensive project undertaken as part of one of my modules, and although I don&amp;rsquo;t usually mention university work in Showcase, this is an exception since everything we did was self-learned.
I was team leader for a team of two (including me), and we built a full-stack cross-platform mobile application designed to help the UK population track and share their wellbeing &amp;amp; steps. The mobile client was built with Flutter and the back-end in Go.</description></item><item><title>GSA Ultra Hackathon</title><link>https://cyberchris.xyz/showcase/gsa-ultra/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cyberchris.xyz/showcase/gsa-ultra/</guid><description>Thanks to GSA Capital for sending me these cool t-shirts for my standing in their recent hackathon.

It&amp;rsquo;s a convenient alternative to using a sed script.
I coded it in a day mostly to learn how to properly write modern (at the time of writing) Python applications, using Poetry and pytest.</description></item><item><title>CLI Youtube Searcher</title><link>https://cyberchris.xyz/showcase/cliyoutube/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cyberchris.xyz/showcase/cliyoutube/</guid><description>Have a look at my blog post.</description></item><item><title>Local Music Playback Skill for MycroftAI</title><link>https://cyberchris.xyz/showcase/mycroftai-music/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cyberchris.xyz/showcase/mycroftai-music/</guid><description>A skill/extension for the MycroftAI assistant that allows playback of downloaded mp3 files with MycroftAI (on Linux).
